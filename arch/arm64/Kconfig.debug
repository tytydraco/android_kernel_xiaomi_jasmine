config ARM64_PTDUMP
	bool "Export kernel pagetable layout to userspace via debugfs"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	select DEBUG_FS
        help
	  Say Y here if you want to show the kernel pagetable layout in a
	  debugfs file. This information is only useful for kernel developers
	  who are working in architecture specific areas of the kernel.
	  It is probably not a good idea to enable this feature in a production
	  kernel.
	  If in doubt, say "N"

config STRICT_DEVMEM
	bool "Filter access to /dev/mem"
	depends on MMU
	help
	  If this option is disabled, you allow userspace (root) access to all
	  of memory, including kernel and userspace memory. Accidental
	  access to this is obviously disastrous, but specific access can
	  be used by people debugging the kernel.

	  If this option is switched on, the /dev/mem file only allows
	  userspace access to memory mapped peripherals.

	  If in doubt, say Y.

config PID_IN_CONTEXTIDR
	bool "Write the current PID to the CONTEXTIDR register"
	help
	  Enabling this option causes the kernel to write the current PID to
	  the CONTEXTIDR register, at the expense of some additional
	  instructions during context switch. Say Y here only if you are
	  planning to use hardware trace tools with this kernel.

config ARM64_RANDOMIZE_TEXT_OFFSET
	bool "Randomize TEXT_OFFSET at build time"
	help
	  Say Y here if you want the image load offset (AKA TEXT_OFFSET)
	  of the kernel to be randomized at build-time. When selected,
	  this option will cause TEXT_OFFSET to be randomized upon any
	  build of the kernel, and the offset will be reflected in the
	  text_offset field of the resulting Image. This can be used to
	  fuzz-test bootloaders which respect text_offset.

	  This option is intended for bootloader and/or kernel testing
	  only. Bootloaders must make no assumptions regarding the value
	  of TEXT_OFFSET and platforms must not require a specific
	  value.

config DEBUG_SET_MODULE_RONX
        bool "Set loadable kernel module data as NX and text as RO"
        depends on MODULES
        help
          This option helps catch unintended modifications to loadable
          kernel module's text and read-only data. It also prevents execution
          of module data. Such protection may interfere with run-time code
          patching and dynamic kernel tracing - and they might also protect
          against certain classes of kernel exploits.
          If in doubt, say "N".

config DEBUG_RODATA
	bool "Make kernel text and rodata read-only"
	default y
	help
	  If this is set, kernel text and rodata will be made read-only. This
	  is to help catch accidental or malicious attempts to change the
	  kernel's executable code.

	  If in doubt, say Y

config DEBUG_ALIGN_RODATA
	depends on DEBUG_RODATA
	bool "Align linker sections up to SECTION_SIZE"
	help
	  If this option is enabled, sections that may potentially be marked as
	  read only or non-executable will be aligned up to the section size of
	  the kernel. This prevents sections from being split into pages and
	  avoids a potential TLB penalty. The downside is an increase in
	  alignment and potentially wasted space. Turn on this option if
	  performance is more important than memory pressure.

	  If in doubt, say N

config FORCE_PAGES
        bool "Force lowmem to be mapped with 4K pages"
        help
          There are some advanced debug features that can only be done when
          memory is mapped with pages instead of sections. Enable this option
          to always map lowmem pages with pages. This may have a performance
          cost due to increased TLB pressure.

          If unsure say N.

config FREE_PAGES_RDONLY
        bool "Set pages as read only while on the buddy list"
        select FORCE_PAGES
        select DEBUG_PAGEALLOC
        help
          Pages are always mapped in the kernel. This means that anyone
          can write to the page if they have the address. Enable this option
          to mark pages as read only to trigger a fault if any code attempts
          to write to a page on the buddy list. This may have a performance
          impact.

          If unsure, say N.

config KERNEL_TEXT_RDONLY
        bool "Set kernel text section pages as read only"
	depends on FREE_PAGES_RDONLY
        depends on !DEBUG_RODATA
        help
          The kernel text pages are always mapped in the kernel.
	  This means that anyone can write to the page if they have
	  the address. Enable this option to mark the kernel text pages
	  as read only to trigger a fault if any code attempts to write
	  to a page part of the kernel text section. This may have a
	  performance impact.

          If unsure, say N.

config ARM64_STRICT_BREAK_BEFORE_MAKE
	bool "Enforce strict break-before-make on page table updates "

config OPTIMIZE_INLINING
	bool "Allow gcc to uninline functions marked 'inline'"
	---help---
	  This option determines if the kernel forces gcc to inline the functions
	  developers have marked 'inline'. Doing so takes away freedom from gcc to
	  do what it thinks is best, which is desirable for the gcc 3.x series of
	  compilers. The gcc 4.x series have a rewritten inlining algorithm and
	  enabling this option will generate a smaller kernel there. Hopefully
	  this algorithm is so good that allowing gcc 4.x and above to make the
	  decision will become the default in the future. Until then this option
	  is there to test gcc for this.

	  If unsure, say N.
